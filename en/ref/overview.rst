Zurmo is an open source CRM application written in PHP utilizing jQuery, Yii Framework, and RedBeanPHP.

Our goal with Zurmo is to provide an easy-to-use, easy-to-customize CRM application that can be adapted to any business use case. We have taken special care to think through many different use cases and have designed a system that we believe provides a high degree of flexibility, covering a wide variety of use cases out of the box.

We don't have a million features. We can never beat out existing players in a feature war.

But considering companies wind up only using a handful of features, we don't think it really matters.

What we have so far is the beginning of a high-quality sales force automation tool. Stay tuned as we continue to make improvements.

From a technical perspective, we are very excited. We have decided to build Zurmo on three awesome development frameworks, Yii, RedBeanPHP, and jQuery. With almost a religious zeal for testing, you will find that our obsession with test driven development means a more stable application.

Gone are the days of 'upgrade and pray'. Now it is 'upgrade and test'.
